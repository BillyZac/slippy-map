# Tomnod map

Explore a map of the globe. Click a spot and we'll show you the latest satellite imagery for that location.

[The map is deployed here.](https://tomnod-map.firebaseapp.com/)

## Development setup
After cloning the repository, run `bower install`. This will install third party libraries (e.g. jQuery).

Switch into the _public_ folder and use an http service to serve the app:

```
$ cd public
$ httpster
```
